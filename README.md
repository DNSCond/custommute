# Custom Mute (u/custommute)

Mute anyone for any duration except if its longer than 28 days or less than 15 seconds

## howto use

its simple write `!mute <time> <timeUnit>` and it works `!muteuser` and `!mute user` work too.

`<time>` is any number as long as its written in base 10 with digits only.

`<timeUnit>` is one of this:

- `hour`
- `minute`
- `second`
- `day`
- `h`
- `m`
- `s`
- `d`

you can add a '`s`' to it.

uninstalling the app will result in the user not getting unmuted when they are supposed to.
